          What draws me to building is the sense that technology, especially emerging tools, can open up new ways of connecting things that didn't quite fit before. Each project often begins by stepping back and asking, What might change if I looked at this from a different angle? I'm interested in the spaces where something small and well-considered can make a bigger impact than expected. Where gaps become bridges, and overlooked problems become opportunities to build something better for everyone.

            <p>I built this as my capstone project, but it came from somewhere much earlier and deeper. It's about making drug safety more personal. Something that uses emerging tech to account for the risks people don't always see coming. This one matters to me more than I usually say.</p>

            <p>This came from something a friend and I kept running into while working on other projects, the tension between building something meaningful and finding the time to share it. Jodon is a close friend I served with in the Army, and we'd both hit the same wall as solo builders. So we started working on a tool that could help people generate content that feels like their own voice. Especially when they're doing everything themselves.</p>

            <p>My dad was a painter, and even though he hoped I'd build a life with my mind instead of my hands, he taught me something I never forgot. That the tools you invest in can shape the future you're able to create. SoloPro came from that mindset. It's an early attempt to support independent workers with software that respects the kind of effort they put into their craft.</p>

            <p>This started as a way to boost my own productivity, making it easier to find and use the right APIs without getting bogged down in technical overhead. But I also built it with a larger shift in mind. As AI lowers the barrier to building, I see more people stepping into roles they wouldn't have attempted before. APIJunction is meant to support that momentum. A tool for solopreneurs and indie builders who want to tap into what emerging tech can do, without needing to learn everything under the hood. It's part of a broader effort to help more people build what they imagine, faster. Like selling shovels in the early days of a new gold rush.</p>

            <p>This project came from a curiosity about the subtle ways language reflects place and how much meaning lives in the way people speak, region to region. I've always loved exploring new places, and part of that for me is learning how people express themselves. As tech continues to blur regional identities, I wanted to build something that does the opposite, using technology to help preserve those nuances and make them easier to appreciate.</p>

            <p>While building Vitacheck, I realized the deeper issue wasn't just outdated tools, it was a lack of awareness. Most people don't realize how common and dangerous certain drug interactions can be, especially when mixing prescriptions with supplements or over-the-counter substances. MedSafe is my way of addressing that gap: using writing, design, and clear information to make these risks more visible, without creating fear. The goal is to help people stay safe by simply knowing more.</p>
